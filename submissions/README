# 1: Get files

First, download all submission files from Google Drive
Convert to xlsx as you download
Google provides a zip file, unzip it. 

# 2: Install xlsx2csv
using a python converter. I installed as follows: 

    virtualenv ENV
    source ENV/bin/activate
    pip install xlsx2xsv

# 3. Short script to convert
Ad hoc script in ipython to do the conversions. 
Adjust this code for proper file / directory locations

    import os
    xls_files = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if f.endswith('.xlsx')]

    from xlsx2csv import Xlsx2csv as xc
    for f in xls_files: 
        csv_name = ''.join(f.split(' ')[:2]) + '.csv'
        xc(f).convert(csv_name, sheetid=1)

# Done.
